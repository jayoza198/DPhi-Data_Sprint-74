# DPhi-Data_Sprint-74

In this Data Sprint Challenge we used different Machine Learning Models to predict the smoking status of that individual based on the data given.

We create a machine learning model to identify the smoking status of an individual using bio-signals. 

The following models are being used to make the prediction model
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier Algorithm
3. Boruta
4. Hyper Parameter Tunning

The following are the prediction % for above models 
1. Logistic Regression - 71.2%
2. Random Forest Classifier Algorithm- 68.9 %
3. Boruta- 73.5 %
4. Hyper Parameter Tunning - 70.9 %

Submitted Prediction File Outcome using Boruta- 78.07 %
